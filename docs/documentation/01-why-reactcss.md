title: Why ReactCSS?
---
ReactCSS builds upon the inline-css work the community has developed with a focus on:

## Class-based Data Structure

ReactCSS uses a class based data structure that makes it easy to "pop" css classes on and off conditionally (similar to adding and removing modifier classes in traditional css) with little to no code.

## Keeping All the Styles Together

Custom components and regular html elements are first-class citizens when it comes to styling in a component. Keeping all of the styles together helps separate the style logic from the display and business logic.

## An Easy Way to Attach Styles

ReactCSS introduces the "is" syntax via the react-map-styles package to handle inline styles on html elements and spreads on custom components.
